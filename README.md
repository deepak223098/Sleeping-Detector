# Sleeping-Detector

How this idea came:
There has many been incidents due to pilot fatigue during the flight operations resulted in Crash.
For example : in Year … such and such plane got crashed. 
Taking it as a problem statement we came up a new algorithm to detect the sleep and alert the crew or ATC. 

This low cost idea implements a sleep detection algorithm that uses Eye ratio and does intelligent computations to detect if the crew has fallen asleep. 


Long back we heard news that one of the airplane crashed due to pilot unintended activity (due to sleep). So because of drowsy eyes he lost his control out of it and plane crashed. It can be avoided with the help of our application.
So we thought that why can’t we create some algorithm that too cost effective to detect pilot face and provide the details that pilot is sleeping or not.
So we come up with an cost effective algorithm to detect the pilot face and alert pilot or co-pilot that pilot is sleeping or not.

Cost estimation:
very cost effective as we are using only two web camera.
